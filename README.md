# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Fractional Width Gap Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using fractional widths (e.g., `w-1/2`) within a Tailwind CSS flexbox container.  The expected behavior is that two `w-1/2` divs should occupy the full width of their parent container. However, a gap often appears between the divs, leading to unexpected layout issues.

The `bug.html` file showcases the problem. The `solution.html` file provides a workaround.
